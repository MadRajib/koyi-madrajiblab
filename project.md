Siskubis is an information system that can manage data at the Yogyakarta State University incubator.

This information system can be a solution for startups or campuses as an innovation in processing startup data so that it can be structured and more efficient in terms of time and arrangement.

Siskubis was built using Laravel as server side and using Blade Templating for the front side and MySQL for DBMS.

I was responsible for creating the Landing Page interface and The Dashboard page.

This project was my stepping stone for learning Laravel and made for learning and tinkering with my Laravel skill.

All Bike is a fully functional blog which can Create Post, Edit Post, View Post, adding Tag and Categories and Delete Post. I also added Disqus' comment.

Built using Laravel as Backend, MySQL as DBMS and deployed to Heroku.

This project was built for Final Project in semester 5 a while ago. 

I tried making a Hybrid Web using Ionic and Angular2 so it can scale to different viewports.

Spurs App is a simple app which can view the next match, latest match, viewing rivals, and saving favourite matches.

It was built using Ionic Framework and Angular also with a help from SportsDB API for data.

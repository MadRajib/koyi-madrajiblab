title: Why i stopped pirating
slug: stop-piracy
---

I used to pirate because i was poor and selfish, but now I generally only pirate:

- Games I have already paid for once. For example, I bought age of empires when it first came out, so im not shelling out $25 again.
- Games that are no longer, or regionally not available (Looking at you, Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance)
- Old console games that i want to emulate (which i generally already have bought anyways)
- Games i want to demo. I usually buy it halfway through if i really enjoy it.

I understand that many companies might see piracy as an issue because less sales=less money, but given that attention is worth more than an actual product nowadays, i think a lot of small/medium companies could -really- benefit from having a more relaxed approach to piracy, or even just go back to distributing demos

Valve was right about piracy being a service problem. Buying something on steam is way easier than torrenting games and downloading cracks while avoiding all the viruses, malwares and trojans.

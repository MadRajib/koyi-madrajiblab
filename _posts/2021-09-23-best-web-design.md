Imo it's a statically generated website with a tiny bit of CSS and Let's Encrypt SSL hosted on a lightweight web server like Ngix. Images should be optimized (see packages like pngquant or jpegoptim) and the right format should be used. Vector images are preferable.

RSS should be supported. Everything should be hosted on the same server so the user doesn't have to do more than one DNS lookup or connect to multiple servers.RSS should be supported.

Your videos should be optimized and offered in multiple formats using royalty free codecs free of DRM. Same with audio. There should be no third party scripts or trackers.

Even if your website relies on JavaScript for advanced features, it should still be viewable without JavaScript and in text based web browsers like w3m or Lynx.
